In this project I used a API to Geolocate WebSites and insert them in a Map.  
This is a project done in ES6, React, Redux, Webpack, npm, Mocha, bootstrap and GoogleMap.
I used React because it is fast, use a virtual DOM, render on client and server, single composition, componet library.
I used Redux  because it is reduced boilerplate, immutable store.
I used WebPack to bundle my app, npm to run script, Mocha to test, bootstrap to stype and Google Map for the map.

To run: npm start -s .
I did some test witch are in the files with extension *.test.js.
